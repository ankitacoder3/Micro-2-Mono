# Mono-2-Micro

## Breaking down monoliths ü™®‚õèÔ∏è
This project has the following objectives:
- Get familiar with reading error stack trace and debugging code.
- Convert a monolith architecture based docker-compose application into a microservices based architecture.  

## Requirements:
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Follow the guides based on your operating system.
- Internet. Pull docker image `python:3.8-alpine` beforehand to avoid connectivity issues.

## Build & Run
```
# under the microservices directory
# NOTE: For any code changes to be reflected, the build command must be rerun, and then up
docker-compose build
# run without the -d flag incase you want to observe the logs
docker-compose up -d
```
### To stop the services in detached mode
```
docker-compose down
```
